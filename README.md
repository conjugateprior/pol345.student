# The pol345.student package

`pol345.student` allows students to unpack and complete precepts for
Princeton University's course Politics 345 (as run by Marc Ratkowic
and Will Lowe in Fall 2018).

## Installation

The problem sets are a bit too big for CRAN, so you'll want to
make sure you've got the `devtools` package installed.  Then grab
the package from GitHub like this:

    devtools::install_github("conjugateprior/pol345.student")

## Notes

* This package contains all the questions, all the data, but none of the
  answers!
* Eventually we'll be replaced by a `learnr` based setup.  In the meantime,
  we're in regular `Rmd`.
